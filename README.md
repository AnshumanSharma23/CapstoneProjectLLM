# Capstone Project README

This repository contains the final presentation of my Capstone Project, which focuses on addressing the inefficiencies in file management through the implementation of an internal chatbot solution powered by generative AI technology. While the codebase is not provided as it is proprietary to the company, the presentation offers a comprehensive overview of the project's objectives, challenges, and solutions.

## Problem Statement

The problem statement presented by the City of Irvine outlines the inefficiencies in file management due to a large and diverse dataset. Manual processes are time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating an Internal ChatGPT solution to enhance data interaction, retrieve information swiftly, and improve overall productivity.

## Functionality Desired

The desired functionality includes:

- Implementation of an internal chatbot powered by a generative AI model (e.g., GPT)
- Advanced semantic search technology for efficient information retrieval
- Integration with diverse knowledge bases, specifically documents in the OnBase Content Services platform

## Challenges

The project encountered several challenges, including:

- Acquiring and preprocessing data
- Efficiently managing large language models
- Selecting the optimal Llama model among multiple options

## LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex, a simple and flexible data framework, was utilized for connecting custom data sources to large language models. It facilitates data ingestion, indexing, and provides a query interface for knowledge-augmented responses.

## ChatGPT Model

The project utilized LLAMA2 to develop a ChatGPT model, as described in detail in the attached presentation. The inference flow and implementation details are elaborated upon for further clarity.
